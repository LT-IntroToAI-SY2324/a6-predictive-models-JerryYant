# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
The data has less data points which aren't outliers.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
That the predicted value has a strong correlation and is likely to occur

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
Compared to the previous graph more accurate as the predicted values line up well with the training date. The meaning of the data shows that the higher the the age, the higher blood pressure increases.
