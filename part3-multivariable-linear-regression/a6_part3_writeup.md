# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
0.85 which means that the predicted data will be a bit over or under the actual data
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
Yes as it is only 1k off compared to the actual price
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
For a car which is 10 years old with 89000 miles it will be worth around $10000, a 20 year old car with 150000 will be around $1000
4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
The price of the vehicle depreciated so much that you lose profit
