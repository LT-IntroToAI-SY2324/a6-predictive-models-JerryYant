# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
0.625, which tells us that the regression line is closer to the points on the scaterplot making it more accurate.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
137.46
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
If we base it on the line of best fit, it's pretty accurate but if we account of other affects like low or high blood pressure or other issues, it becomes innacurrate. There isn't really a solution except for creating spereate data sets for the outliers in the data.
